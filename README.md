# Fam.
_The second iteration of The Getup now featuring React._ 

In Kate Leaver's book [The Friendship Cure](http://kateleaver.com/book) she discusses the art and science of friendship and why we need each other more than ever. In it, she explores the life-threatening effects of living a life disconnected from a close group of friends.. it's an eye opener to our current, "connected" world. The purpose of this app is to make those connections real and much easier to create by making travel more affordable. 

Fam is an app designed to revitalize living a healthy and happy life by splitting the costs for casual trips between friends. Traveling with friends just got a whole lot easier ✈️
